                        The plot takes place in a medieval-fantasy universe, the kingdom of Hyrule. The latter is devastated following a disaster that took place a century before the adventure, and thus presents many temples and buildings in ruins. Nature, by its fauna and flora, is however omnipresent. Many wild animals can be encountered and hunted, such as wolves, wild boars, foxes or fish, and many insects and plants can serve as resources</p>
